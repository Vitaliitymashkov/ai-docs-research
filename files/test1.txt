The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679),[1] abbreviated GDPR, is a European Union regulation on information privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR is an important component of EU privacy law and human rights law, in particular Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It also governs the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA. The GDPR's goals are to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal information and to simplify the regulations for international business.[2] It supersedes the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and, among other things, simplifies the terminology.

The European Parliament and Council of the European Union adopted the GDPR on 14 April 2016, to become effective on 25 May 2018. As an EU regulation (instead of a directive), the GDPR has direct legal effect and does not require transposition into national law. However, it also provides flexibility for individual member states to modify (derogate from) some of its provisions.

As an example of the Brussels effect, the regulation became a model for many other laws around the world, including in Brazil, Japan, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.[citation needed][3] After leaving the European Union the United Kingdom enacted its "UK GDPR", identical to the GDPR.[4] The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), adopted on 28 June 2018, has many similarities with the GDPR.[5]
